# Hi, I'm Keith

Software engineer with a background in philosophy and experience building full-stack systems for education and research. I’ve worked on interactive learning platforms, developer-facing tools, and production systems that support real users, with a growing focus on AI-enabled products and human–computer interaction.

Before software, I worked in scientific publishing, collaborating closely with researchers and editors, which shaped how I think about clarity, rigor, and translating complex ideas into usable systems. I’m currently completing an MS in Computer Science at Georgia Tech, focusing on AI and ML.

Outside of work, I’m active in the Burning Man community and enjoy conversations about big ideas, systems, and how technology actually gets used by people.
